# How to guides and scripts

This is a something called a Jupyter Workbench. It contains a Jupyter Notebook that documents how I have geocoded a collection of archaeological reports from the National Library of Australia's online library catalogue *Trove*. It is a work in progress.

Here you can [Read my walk through to geocoding reports from *Trove*](https://archaeologynearme-npitt.notebooks.azure.com/j/notebooks/Extracting%20and%20geolocating%20reports%20from%20Trove.ipynb)

Please contact me if you have any questions at [contact@archaeology-near-me.com](mailto:contact@archaeology-near-me.com)
