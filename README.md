# Worked examples for Archaeology Near Me

[Archaeology Near Me](https://archaeology-near-me.com/) is a new approach to viewing the location of archaeological reports. It takes existing lists and databases of archaeological reports and uses the report titles to geolocate the reports and present these on an interactive map. Databases the site uses include as the [NSW Archaeology On-Line Grey Literature Archive](http://nswaol.library.usyd.edu.au/search), the [Heritage NSW Library](https://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/search-for-heritage/heritage-nsw-library/) and the National Library of Australia's online library catalogue [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/). At present the site is focused on the Australian state of New South Wales.

This Github repository lets you look behind the scenes and see how I have created the website. I hope that it will be useful for people working elsewhere. Over time I'll add code and Jupyter Notebooks - combinations of code and text that let you see how I've incorporated short bits of code with other manual methods to create *Archaeology Near Me*.
