The bulk of this collection comprises cargo objects, destined for sale in the Swan River colony. The protection afforded artefacts, due to the integrity of these shipwrecks, presents new research opportunites for identifying particular classes of commodities which were considered either necessary or desirable for colonial consumers. This thesis examines the notion of material consumption as reflected in shipwreck assemblages in Western Australia for the later nineteenth century, prior to Federation. The research is concerned with the notion of cultural continuity from Britain through specific product selection, as demonstrated by the archaeological assemblages of iron barques importing general merchandise into the colony. Focusing on the Sepia (1898), the objectives include an appraisal of shipwreck cargo artefacts and their applicability to questions relating to consumer behaviour. While the primary objective of this study is on the identification of cargo assemblages, it presents an opportunity to study taphonomic processes and provide a method of relating the vessel to its cargo contents in order to answer broader questions about shipping practices, with a particular focus on stowage. This research also critiques shipwreck collections comprised of selectively recovered, unprovenanced artefacts and suggests appropriate methods for using such material.

The archaeology of Sydney's Aboriginal history,"Irish, Paul",2012-2016,2012,"Archaeological research into Sydney's Aboriginal past has overwhelmingly focused on the pre-contact period, while historical archaeology focusing on Aboriginal heritage has mostly been undertaken in regional or remote areas. Despite this, a range of approaches and techniques has been developed through these and other studies that can now be applied to the Aboriginal historical archaeology of urban areas. This paper collates and examines the physical evidence of the historical Aboriginal use of Sydney, which reveals a continuous history of Aboriginal associations with the Sydney area. Although scant, the physical evidence can be combined with detailed archival research to create a more rounded picture of how Aboriginal people responded to the growth of urban centres like Sydney. Many documented Aboriginal links to places (including extant buildings) are intangible associations but can be mapped to illustrate the complex and shifting connections which typify urban Aboriginal histories. The range of available methods and sources also provides broader scope for meaningful collaborations with urban Aboriginal communities, which are essential for this research to succeed.

					February 2005 saw the second year of archaeological fieldwork at the historic Mill Point site, situated on the shores of Lake Cootharaba in the Cooloola Section of Great Sandy National Park. Mill Point is the site of one of the earliest timber settlements in Queensland, operating between 1869 and 1892. It has long been recognised as of State significance by the National Trust and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Mill Point Archaeological Project was initiated in 2004 primarily in response to community concerns about the long-term future of the site. The project aims to inform ongoing management and preservation issues as well as enhancing our understanding of colonial life in a rural setting. The 2005 field season specifically aimed to build upon the detailed survey work that was commenced during 2004. This year the site also became the focus for the research projects of two PhD students from the University of Queensland.

191689606,http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/191689606,Global regional and local networks: archaeological investigation of the Western Australian penal colony 1850-1875,"Winter, Sean",2013,2013,"Abstract: [Truncated abstract] The Western Australian penal colony, enacted in 1850 and lasting until the mid-1870s, has typically been examined as the end product of a larger pan-Australian process of convict transportation. As such Western Australian convictism has been viewed as essentially the same as that enacted in the Eastern Australian penal colonies, but on a much smaller scale, and crucially, as unimportant within the greater story of Australian convictism. This view has been exacerbated by a concerted effort in Western Australia itself to erase the convict period from colonial memory. In comparison with New South Wales and Tasmania, there has been very little archaeological or historical research conducted into the Western Australian penal system. Consequently we know very little about the operation of the system, the lives of the convicts within it and the impact it had on the development of Western Australia. This view that Western Australian convictism was basically the same as that in the eastern Australian colonies is problematic because the system existed within a penal paradigm that was fundamentally different to the one which inspired the settling of New South Wales 60 years earlier. In 1850 British transportation occurred within a legislative and ideological framework that was focussed on reform and incarceration, rather than the simple removal of unwanted criminals. Transportation was no longer considered an effective punishment and the practice was only continued by the British government to advance specific strategic interests and operated within a global administrative and legislative framework applied equally in different penal colonies. Modelling of this global framework demonstrates that the form and operation of the Western Australian system had as much in common with contemporary penal colonies in Bermuda and Gibraltar, as with earlier systems in New South Wales and Tasmania. Physically, Western Australian convictism was designed to meet both the needs of the British penal system and those of the colony. Fremantle Prison, the central hub of the network, operated under the same legislation as any other British prison within the Empire and was intended for the reform, control and punishment of newly arrived and recalcitrant convicts. However the ""ticket-of-leave"" system, a limited form of parole, was extensively used outside the prison to mobilise convict labour and ticket-of-leave men were dispersed throughout a network of eight regional convict depots and subsidiary work stations. Archaeological and historical investigation of three convict depots, at York, Toodyay and Guildford, demonstrate that away from Fremantle, traditional penal concerns of security, control and reform were low priority. Instead, these places were designed to allow settler access to convict labour and to reinforce traditional British class hierarchies...

The likelihood that there is a cultural association between the Pleistocene date and the stone artefacts found in the same deposits is considered.

The archaeology of Australian colonial frontier massacres,"Litster, Mirani",2011-2016,2011,"Amongst other issues, the 'History Wars' raise the question as to whether or not sites of conflict on the Australian colonial frontier will be preserved in the archaeological record. We explore this question through a consideration of what the expected nature of any such evidence might be, based on general and specific historical accounts and an understanding of site formation processes. Although limited success has been achieved to date in locating definitive evidence for such sites in Australia, we conclude that there are some specific situations where archaeology could usefully be applied to give rise to a more multi-dimensional understanding of the past.

    community-based archaeological research project in the Esperance
    region, southern Western Australia. It is based on analysis of
    rock art, stone arrangements and flaked stone artefacts. The aim
    is to understand the role of the study sites  Belinup and
    Marbaleerup  within patterns of movement that underpinned
    society and economy in this region during the late-Holocene. The
    research explores concepts of identity (Jones 1997; Meskell and
    Preucel 2004) relating to the local Esperance Nyungar people, and
    the broader Noongar and Western Desert cultural blocs. It has
    been suggested that negotiations over territory, law and identity
    during the recent past were directly related to the expansion of
    the Western Desert cultural bloc (Gibbs and Veth 2002), which
    situates the study area at a dynamic frontier of cultural change.
    Exploration of these questions leads to a discussion about the
    historical construction of Esperance Nyungar identity.
    
    The study sites are hypothesised to have functioned in the past
    as aggregation locales (Conkey 1980). Investigation of this
    hypothesis is illuminative; firstly, for understanding more about
    the study sites; and secondly about the application of the
    aggregation concept, and its limitations for archaeology. The
    results inform a discussion of how mobility (Binford 1980; Kelly
    1992) and aggregation can be usefully applied together to
    investigate the intersections of social and economic elements in
    hunter-gatherer settlement.
    
    As a conceptual tool for archaeology, identity is challenging
    because it cannot be directly interpreted from material culture
    in a simple way. Despite the challenges, identity is an important
    tool for understanding past societies. Identity is investigated
    here by mapping the occurrence of symbols across landscapes and
    considering how these may, or may not, relate to notions of
    identity and connections to place. The approach begins with what
    is known (contemporary identity and connection), and works
    backwards through time and outwards through space towards the
    unknown. Identity is a powerful way to link the archaeological
    past with the contemporary descendent community.
    
    The process of undertaking a community-based research partnership
    is discussed, with critical reflection on the challenges and
    successes. An argument is presented for how and why community
    input and ownership is critical to the success of archaeological
    research into Aboriginal pasts in Australia and abroad.
    
    The results demonstrate the inherent dynamism in Aboriginal
    society in southern Western Australia and highlight a historical
    legacy to the processes of cultural change underpinning Esperance
    Nyungar identity today. Those processes predate the colonial
    interruption, and continue into the post-Native Title era. This
    leads to a discussion and critique of the Native Title system,
    which often neglects to acknowledge the nuanced realities of
    Aboriginal societies and the inherent mutability of identity and
    connections across time and space. It is argued that the internal
    social dynamics of Aboriginal society are an important part of
    identity, as people continually negotiate who they are and how
    they relate to people and places. This constant process of
    identity-making is a fundamental part of Aboriginal culture and
    society now and into the distant past.

232303471,http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/232303471,The Archaeological Investigation of Rock Art in the Philippines,"Jalandoni, Andrea",2018,2018,"Austronesians are a genetically-related people, recognized by the similarities in their
languages, and with a shared past evidenced by material culture. Research into the origin and
migration route of Austronesians has progressed through the disciplines of Linguistics,
Archaeology, and Genetics. Out of Taiwan is currently the dominant theory with strong
evidence from the three disciplines involved. Consequentially, the Philippines is the first stop
of the migrating Austronesians, and therefore the closest link to the homeland in Taiwan
linguistically, archaeologically, and genetically. The archaeological approach to understand the
Austronesian diaspora has been tracing material culture like nephrite and ceramics. However,
rock art as a traceable material culture has been underutilized, especially in places like the
Philippines where the rock art is relatively unknown and lacks research. The two rock art styles
that have been identified in Borneo, East Timor, and Southwest Pacific and have been linked
to Austronesians are the Austronesian Painting Tradition (APT) and the Austronesian
Engraving Style (AES). The aim of this research has been to test the validity of APT and AES in
the Philippines.
An inventory of rock art of the Philippines was needed to enable descriptions and comparisons
with the region. This was achieved through low-cost 3D modelling using Structure-from-
Motion (SfM) photogrammetry. However, the physical and socio-economic environment in
the Philippines makes rock art research a difficult undertaking. One of the challenges of
studying Philippine rock art was the geological condition obfuscating the rock art at some of
the sites. Remote sensing techniques were used during this research to address the issue.
Specifically, an innovative method of combining SfM and GIS (Geographic Information
Systems) algorithms was developed so that obscure engraved rock art was made clearly
visible. Being able to properly identify the rock art allowed for a more accurate inventory,
thereby increasing the reliability of the interpretations.
There are 22 verified rock art sites in the Philippines and seven areas with alleged sites. Of the
verified sites, four have engravings, 16 have black figures, and two have predominantly orange
figures. Four of the sites (three engraving and one painting site) were completely recorded
with 3D models which resulted in spatially-linked databases of the three engraving sites. All
other sites were described from past publications, museum reports, and empirical
observations. By compiling the rock art in an inventory and comparing the inventory to the
prescribed qualities of APT and AES, it is evident that APT and AES are not descriptive of
Philippine rock art. Furthermore, primary sources of Taiwanese rock art reveal that it is highly unlikely APT originated in Taiwan since there is no known painted rock art on the island.
Although the Taiwanese engraved rock art matches the description of AES and could therefore
originate in Taiwan, it is inconclusive because the description of AES is too generic.
A systematic quantitative literature review of the rock art of Southeast Asia and Micronesia
was compiled to ascertain the amount of research conducted and to compare the inventory
of the Philippines with the rock art of the region. For example, parallels in anthropomorphic
depictions are found within the Philippines and between the Philippines and the region. Aside
from determining similarities, conspicuous absences in motifs and styles were also noted, such
as hand stencils and painted boats. An example of the unique aspect of Philippine rock art is
the textured vulva-forms of Alab because they are not similar to the few other examples of
engraved vulva-forms in Southeast Asia. In addition, a summary of Micronesian rock art is
provided which might be the first for the region. Micronesian rock art potentially has
information of an Austronesian style of rock art. The first colonizers of Micronesia were
Austronesians and they remained the sole inhabitants for millennia on some islands until
European contact in the 16th century, making the rock art found in Micronesia very likely
Austronesian.
Cost-effective techniques were emphasized throughout the research, not just as an efficient
way to conduct this particular research but also to encourage the continuity of the research
into Philippine rock art. Beyond the Philippines, the methods are relevant to any rock art
research on a limited budget, which is typical of most rock art projects. It should be noted that
the methods employed, while low-cost, were still state-of-the-art for rock art recording. With
a baseline of the current conditions of the rock art sites, a longitudinal study can be organised
for the quantitative monitoring of change. In addition to answering archaeological questions,
the inventory can be used to develop conservation plans and influence government policies.

thesis is primarily concerned with human-environment interactions on the tropical coast of
northern Australia during the late Holocene. Based on the suggestion that significant change
can occur within short time-frames as a direct result of interactive processes, the archaeological
evidence from the Point Blane peninsula, Blue Mud Bay, is used to address the issue of how
much change and variability occurred in hunter-gatherer economic and social structures during
the late Holocene in coastal northeastern Arnhem Land. The suggestion proposed in this thesis
is that processes of environmental and climatic change resulted in changes in resource
distribution and abundance, which in turn affected patterns of settlement and resource
exploitation strategies, levels of mobility and, potentially, the size of foraging groups on the
coast. Whereas previous archaeological models for coastal northern Australia have used
ethnographies as interpretive tools, it is demonstrated that using ethnographies to aid
interpretations of the archaeological record is a problematic approach for this specific region. In
particular, such an approach has most likely underestimated the nature and extent of variability
that may have existed in the late Holocene. Therefore, the focus here is on what the
archaeological and ecological evidence can tell us about human behaviour in the late Holocene.
The question of human behavioural variability relative to the climatic and ecological parameters
of the last 3000 years in Blue Mud Bay has been addressed by examining issues of scale and
resolution in archaeological interpretation. Specifically, the differential chronological and
spatial patterning of shell midden and mound sites on the peninsula in conjunction with
variability in molluscan resource exploitation. To this end, the biological and ecological
characteristics of Anadara granosa, the dominant molluscan species for much of the known
period of occupation in the region, are considered in detail, in combination with assessing the
potential for human impact through predation. In explaining long-term economic change, the
focus has been placed on the analysis of relative changes and trends through time in prehistoric
resource exploitation, and their relationship to environmental factors. This thesis therefore
makes a contribution to our knowledge of pre-contact coastal foragers by viewing the
archaeological record as a reflection of the process of the interaction of humans with their
environment. In doing so, an opportunity is provided in which change can be recognised in a
number of ways. For example, differential focus on resources, variations in group size and
levels of mobility can all be identified. It has also been shown that human-environment
interactions are non-linear or progressive, and that human behaviour during the late Holocene
was both flexible and dynamic.

For this reason, the concept of a global, or international 'mining culture' (e.g. see Lawrence Cheney 1995: 9, 46), was identified as potentially being a useful analytical tool when studying gold rush era sites due to the similar demographic, political and social conditions in gold mining communities, and their potential to be manifest in the archaeological record. This thesis evaluates that hypothesis by analysing, within its local, national, and global perspective, data collected from three archaeological sites in the Upper Murchison region of Western Australia. Findings suggest that, although a global perspective in archaeological analyses is important, when the local context and its impact on the archaeological record is taken into account, the interpretation of sites in terms of overarching global patterns becomes less tenable. It is undeniable that gold rush/mining era sites have comparable facets and general patterns. However, when these sites are approached from an agencycentred perspective that privileges the local rather than the global context, the complexities inherent in social relations, demography, and political and ideological conditions are more likely to be revealed.
